    Myers algorithm: Looks for the shortest path from
    (0, 0) to (n, m) in a graph representing edit
    scripts turning a sequence of size n into a
    sequence of size m.

    This is a recursive implementation which starts
    from both ends of the graph meeting somewhere in the
    middle. It then uses the middle point to split the
    problem into two smaller ones. This allows finding
    the optimal script using a linear amount of memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n
        The length of the first sequence.
    m
        The length of the second sequence.
    similarity_ratio_getter
        A callable(i, j) telling the similarity ratio between
        element i of the first sequence and element j
        of the second sequence.
    out
        The buffer to write the edit script to. If None (default)
        will skip writing the edit script and compute the diff
        cost only. The edit script as an array of these integers:

        - 1 for horizontal moves ("deletions")
        - 2 for vertical moves ("additions")
        - 3 followed by zero for diagonal moves ("same").
    accept
        The minimal similarity ratio to accept as "equal".
    max_cost
        The maximal allowed cost of the graph path
        (edit script). This has the meaning of the
        maximal number of additions and deletions allowed
        in the final diff. Setting this to smaller values
        allows earlier returns.
    max_calls
        The maximal number of calls (iterations) after which
        the algorithm gives up. This has to be lower than n * m
        to have any effect.
    eq_only
        If True, only figures out whether there is an edit script
        with the cost equal or below max_cost without further
        optimizing it. When this argument set to True, nothing
        is writen to `out`.

        Note that without specifying max_cost explicitly
        setting eq_only=True will return almost instantly as
        the default value of max_cost is very large.
    ext_no_python
        If True will disallow slow python-based comparison protocols
        (c kernel only).
    ext_2d_kernel
        If True, will enable fast kernels computing ratios for 2D
        numpy inputs with matching trailing dimension.
    ext_2d_kernel_weights
        Optional weights for the above.
    i, j
        Offsets for calling similarity_ratio_getter and
        writing the edit script.

    Returns
    -------
    The diff cost: the number of deletions + the number
    of additions.

    First, the diff problem is presented as a directed graph problem
    where nodes are sitting on an n x m grid. Each node is connected
    to adjacent grid points, some nodes are connected along the diagonal.
    The aim is to find the shortest "edit script": a path connecting
    (0, 0) and (n, m).
    
      0   1   2   3   4
    0 ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎
      ↓ ↘ ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓
    1 ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎
      ↓   ↓   ↓ ↘ ↓ ↘ ↓
    2 ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎
      ↓   ↓ ↘ ↓   ↓   ↓
    3 ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎ → ◉︎
    
    (n=4, m=3 in the above example)
    
    The cost of the edit script is an integer indicating how many
    horizontal and vertical edges it contains.
    Thus, the edit script with a minimal cost would include the
    maximal possible number of diagonal moves that come for free.
    In the present implementation, diagonal edges are defined implicitly:
    the digaonal move ``(i, j) -> (i + 1, j + 1)`` is present if
    (and only if) ``diag(i, j) >= accept``.
    
    A generic breadth-first search will work here but it requires ``O(n * m)``
    memory to remember the cost of reaching each of the nodes on the grid.
    Thus, the second trick is to track the progress of the breadth-first
    search along diagonals only which has a lower O(min(n, m)) memory
    requirement. The drawback is that we will not be able to recover
    the optimal path in the end of the search. But we will still be able
    to compute its cost.
    
    To visualise the approach, you may rotate the graph by 45d.

    Effectively, 0<=x<=n and 0<=y<=m coordinates are transformed into
    "diagonal" and "progress" coordinates: both running 0..n + m.
    At each iteration if the breadth-first search we update the
    "front": that is, for each diagonal value we increase the "progress"
    by 1 or more if we are allowed to move along the former diagonals.
    
    The third trick is to perform two updates simultaneously: downwards
    from (0, 0) and upwards from (n, m). When the two fronts meet
    (somewhere in the middle) we stop and recover one point of the
    optimal edit script. Then, we may perform recursive calls to recover
    the rest of the edit script.
