    Computes a diff between sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a
        The first sequence.
    b
        The second sequence.
    eq
        Equality measure. Can be either of these:
        - a function ``fun(i, j) -> float`` telling the similarity ratio
          from 0 (dissimilar) to 1 (same).
        - a pair of sequences ``(a_, b_)`` substituting the input sequences
          when computing the diff. The returned chunks, however, are still
          composed of elements from a and b.
    accept
        The lower threshold for the equaity measure.
    min_ratio
        The ratio below which the algorithm exits. The values closer to 1
        typically result in faster run times while setting to 0 will force
        the algorithm to crack through even completely dissimilar sequences.
    max_cost
        The maximal cost of the diff: the number corresponds to the maximal
        count of dissimilar/misaligned elements in both sequences. Setting
        this to zero is equivalent to setting min_ratio to 1. The algorithm
        worst-case time complexity scales with this number.
    max_calls
        The maximal number of calls (iterations) after which the algorithm gives
        up. This has to be lower than ``len(a) * len(b)`` to have any effect.
    max_recursion
        The maximal recursion depth.
    eq_only
        If True, attempts to guarantee the existence of an edit script
        satisfying both min_ratio and max_cost without actually finding the
        script. This provides an early stop and further savings in run times
        is some cases. If set, enforces rtn_diff=False.
    kernel
        The kernel to use:
        - 'py': python implementation of Myers diff algorithm
        - 'c': cython implementation of Myers diff algorithm
    rtn_diff
        If True, computes and returns the diff. Otherwise, returns the
        similarity ratio only. Computing the similarity ratio only is
        typically faster and consumes less memory.
        This option also accepts an array: if an array passed will
        perform a full diff and store codes into the provided array
        while the returned object will be the same as rtn_diff=False.
    dig
        Once set to ``fun(i, j)``, the values of ``Chunk.eq`` in the
        output will be replaced by the values returned by the function.
    strict
        If True, ensures that the returned diff either satisfies both
        min_ratio and max_cost or otherwise has a zero ratio.
    resume
        If specified, will resume the search from the provided state.
    no_python
        If True will disallow slow python-based comparison protocols
        (c kernel only).

    Returns
    -------
    A diff object describing the diff.
